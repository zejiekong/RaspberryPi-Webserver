# RaspberryPi-Webserver
Flask app to deploy web scrapper web application. Socketio is used in order to provide real-time updates to user.This web server will ultimately be hosted on a Raspberry Pi.

### Back-end ( FLASK)

I started off this project by initializing a basic client-server framework, using flask and apache server . Initial thoughts was to solely rely on Flask to deploy the web application. However, Flask is only meant for prototyping and is not recommended for actual use.

Next step was to create a URL so that this web application can be accessed anywhere in the world. Local tunneling is selected for this purpose after attempting many other options like port forwarding and using the public IP.  However, the URL generated by local tunneling is random. A workaround for this problem is to set up a subdomain manually but this has to be done every time the web app is deployed. Besides, it also seems that local tunneling does not provide sufficient security.

This web application is created for my own personal use. Feel free to take a look.
