# RaspberryPi-Webserver
Flask app to deploy web scrapper application to a dynamic website. Socketio is used in order to provide real-time updates to user.

### Back-end ( FLASK)

I started off this project by initializing a basic client-server framework, using flask and apache server . Initial thoughts was to solely rely on Flask to deploy the web application. However, Flask is only meant for prototyping and is not recommended for actual use. 

Next step was to create a URL so that this web application can be accessed anywhere in the world. Otherwise, I can only use this app when my device is connected to the same network. This would make the user experience feel constrained. I chose local tunneling for this purpose after attempting many other options like port forwarding and using the public IP.  However, the URL generated by local tunneling is random. A workaround this problem is to set up a subdomain manually but this has to be done every time the web app is deployed. Besides, it also seems that local tunneling does not provide sufficient security.

This web application is created for my own personal use and I won't be storing any confidential information so I need not worry too much about website traffics and other potential network problems. Hence, I feel this would do.
